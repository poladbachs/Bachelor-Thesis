Row 360:
You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output either 0 or 1, and no other text:

0. Wrong Implementation: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.
1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.

# Description:
- Behavior: The function checks if there is enough space in the data array, enlarges it if necessary, and appends two bytes to the current ByteVector.
- Signature Description: @param byteValue1 int: First byte value to append.
   @param byteValue2 int: Second byte value to append.
   @return ByteVector: The updated ByteVector instance.
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Preconditions: data is a non-null byte array. Postconditions: ByteVector length increases by 2 if there is space, otherwise data is enlarged.

# Signature:
final ByteVector put11(final int byteValue1,final int byteValue2){

# Candidate:
final ByteVector put11(final int byteValue1,final int byteValue2){
    return put1(byteValue1).put1(byteValue2);
}

# Description:
- Behavior: Constructs a string representing a range of data items being accessed, based on limit, offset, and total count values.
- Signature Description: @return String: A content range string formatted as "offset-limit/count".
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Limit, offset, and count may be null and, if so, are assigned default values, the string reflects range from offset to limit or count.
