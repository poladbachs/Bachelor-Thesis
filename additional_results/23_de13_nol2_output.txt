You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output either 0 or 1, and no other text:

0. Wrong Implementation: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.

# Description:
- Summary: Appends array details to a StringBuffer.
- Signature Description: @param buffer StringBuffer: The buffer to append details into
   @param fieldName String: The name of the field being processed
   @param array byte[]: The array whose details are to be appended
- Examples: byte[] {1, 2} -> StringBuffer containing "[1,2]" (basic example)
byte[] {} -> StringBuffer containing "[]" (empty array)
byte[] {4} -> StringBuffer containing "[4]" (single element)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Assumes arrayStart, arraySeparator, and arrayEnd are predefined strings; ensures fields are correctly appended to buffer.

# Description:

current == null, advance()
!= null -> true (found a next element after advancing)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: The 'current' element starts either null or pointing to an element, and may trigger events when moving to the next element. The function returns whether a subsequent non-null element is available.

# Description:
- Summary: Compares two byte arrays for equality up to a given count.
- Signature Description: @param a byte[]: The first byte array.
@param b byte[]: The second byte array.
@param count int: The number of elements to compare.
@return boolean: True if the first 'count' elements are equal, false otherwise.
@throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: If 'count' exceeds array bounds.
- Examples: [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 3 -> true (arrays are equal)
[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], 3 -> false (last elements differ)
[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 2 -> true (first two elements equal)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Arrays must have at least 'count' elements; the function returns a boolean indicating equality of the specified portion of arrays.

1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.

# Notes

Row 362:
You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output either 0 or 1, and no other text:

0. Wrong Implementation: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.
1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.

# Description:
- Summary: Builds a content range string for pagination.
- Signature Description: @return String: A content range string formatted as "offset-limit/count".
- Examples: limit=10, offset=5, count=50 -> "5-9/50" (normal range scenario)
limit=null, offset=null, count=null -> "0-49/0" (fall back to defaults)
limit=0, offset=10, count=15 -> "10-14/15" (limit is 0, output adjusted)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Limit, offset, and count may be null and, if so, are assigned default values, the string reflects range from offset to limit or count.

# Signature:
public static String buildContentRange(int offset, int count) {

# Candidate:
public static String buildContentRange(int offset, int count) {
    if (count == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Count must be positive.");
    }
    String contentRange = String.format("bytes %d-%d/%d", offset, offset + count - 1, count);
    return contentRange;
}

# Output:
1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.
