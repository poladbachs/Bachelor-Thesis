# Description:
- Behavior: The function trims leading and trailing whitespace from each string in the input array. If the array or its elements are null, it returns an empty string or null respectively.

["foo", "bar"] -> ["foo", "bar"] (no spaces to trim)
null -> [] (handles null input)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Input array may contain null elements and will be safely handled, resulting in trimmed strings or nulls in the output.

- Behavior: The function searches for the byte value in the buffer array starting at index pos and returns the index if found, else returns -1.

You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output either 0 or 1, and no other text:

0. Wrong Implementation: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.
1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.

# Description:
- Behavior: This function takes a string and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order. If the input string is null, it returns null.
- Examples: "hello" -> "olleh" (reverses characters)
"12345" -> "54321" (reverses numeric string)
null -> null (null input returns null)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: The function expects a string or null as input; it returns a reversed string or null if the input is null.

# Candidate:
public static void main(String[] args) {

"world", 1, 4 -> "orl" (extracts characters from index 1 to 3)
"java", 2, 4 -> "va" (extracts characters from index 2 to 3)

# Description:
- Behavior: The function reverses the order of elements in the array from index 'from' to 'to'. It swaps elements symmetrically until the middle of the specified range is reached.
- Examples: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1, 3 -> [1, 4, 3, 2, 5] (subarray [2, 3, 4] reversed)
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 0, 2 -> ['c', 'b', 'a', 'd'] (subarray ['a', 'b', 'c'] reversed)
[5, 4, 3], 0, 2 -> [3, 4, 5] (entire array reversed)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Indices must be within array bounds; 'from' <= 'to'. After execution, the array elements between 'from' and 'to' are reversed.

# Description:
- Behavior: The function iterates through a list of keys and applies a set of functions to find the smallest integer bound for each key, returning a list of these bounds.
- Examples: [key1, key2] -> [10, 15] (example with two keys producing distinct bounds)
[key1, key1] -> [10, 10] (same key yielding identical bounds)
[key1] -> [10] (single key results in a single bound)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: The keys list must be non-null, and each function must accept a key and return a non-null integer, resulting in a list of calculated bounds.

You will be provided with the description ("Description") and the signature ("Signature") of a Java function to implement. You will also see a candidate implementation ("Candidate"). Your role is to evaluate the correctness of the Candidate, providing as output either 0 or 1, and no other text:

0. Wrong Implementation: The implementation does not correctly implement the described function.
1. Correct Implementation: The implementation correctly implements the described function.

# Description:
- Behavior: Reads and returns the next tag as an integer from a buffer, resetting or validating the tag as necessary.
- Examples: Buffer empty -> 0 (No tag read)
Valid buffer with tag -> tag value (Returns the tag)
Invalid tag -> Exception (Throws error)
- Preconditions and Postconditions: Buffer must be set, returns a valid tag or resets to 0 if empty, throws exception on invalid tag.

# Description:
- Behavior: The function checks if there is enough space in the data array, enlarges it if necessary, and appends two bytes to the current ByteVector.

put11(255, 0)
-> ByteVector (appends bytes 255 and 0)

# Description:
- Behavior: Constructs a string representing a range of data items being accessed, based on limit, offset, and total count values.

limit=0, offset=10, count=15 -> "10-14/15" (limit is 0, output adjusted)
